[Intro]
Enviyon on the mix
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I ball on these hoes and I flex, did it on my own
I'm in the cut with a TEC, this ain't what he want
She just want the diamonds on my neck, she gon' catch a cold
I just fell in love with her neck, I can't let her go
I can't let her go
'Member when I met her in the trap, she was scraping bowls
Whipping work, running from the cops, she was hitting curbs
In the car, singing all my songs, she knew all the words

[Chorus]
Then I lost her
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
I just lost her
Even though I got all of these hoes on my roster
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
I just lost her, just lost her
Yeah, I just lost her
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
I just lost her
Even though I got all of these hoes on my roster
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
I just lost her, just lost her
Yeah, I just lost her
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
I just lost her
Even though I got all of these hoes on my roster
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
I just lost her
[Verse 2]
Give me head in my joggers (Yah)
You thought these were Nikes? Sorry these Balenciagas (Yah)
They thought I was the devil because I had all the Prada (Yah)
Keep the heavy metal in my skin, these like a rocker
9 9 9, fuck 'em all, that's the motto (Hey)
If he run up, I will fill him up with hollows (Ayy)
I sip Hennessy, won't catch me popping bottles (Ayy)
Up in VIP seducing all the models, ayy
Don't blink, put the Raf Simons on to complement the Mink
There's a room full of hoes getting wet for me
But they only wanna fuck me for my Louis V (Yeah, ayy)
Told her don't blink, got the Raf Simon pants complement the Mink
There's a room full of hoes getting wet for me
But they only wanna fuck me for my Louis V
So I lost her

[Chorus]
W-woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
I just lost her
Even though I got all of these hoes on my roster
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
I just lost her, just lost her
Yeah, I just lost her
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
I just lost her
Even though I got all of these hoes on my roster
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
I just lost her, just lost her
[Verse 3]
I just lost her
Fucked her for the minute even though I didn't want her
I grew up with them niggas that was serving on the corner
I was on my trap phone taking all the orders
When I lost her (When I lost her)
Wo-woah, I just lost her (I just lost her)
Wo-woah, I just lost her (I just lost her)

[Outro]
I just lost her
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
I just lost her
I was looking in the water
