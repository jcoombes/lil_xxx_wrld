[Chorus]
I'm apart, I'm exposed
I'm the flaws, hell if I know
I'm the cause, the cuts, and the deep wounds
Made it this far
If I can then you can too

[Verse 1]
If I can, then you can too
If I can then you can too, woo
Been a long fight, still no truth (Oh yeah)
Been a long night, sippin' on chop and screw juice
She said she wanna screw Juice
Her boyfriend like, "Screw Juice"
Hit 'em with the ooh-la-la
Then hit 'em with the doom-doom
Everyday my heart racin', Lamborghini, shit on vroom-vroom
Everyday my heart racin', for no reason, what have I come to?
Yeah, what have I turned to?
A lot of people turn their back on me, what have I turned to?
Man, fuck that shit, I gotta stay true
Sippin' on Actavis in my panic room

[Chorus]
I'm apart, I'm exposed
I'm the flaws, hell if I know
I'm the cause, the cuts, and the deep wounds
Made it this far
If I can then you can too
[Verse 2]
Drugs in my hand (My hand), what I'm gon' do? (Yeah)
I'm a high guy (High guy), kinda fly too
Cupid did a drive-by, shot me from the sunroof
Hit a nigga ten times, Gucci shirt, I bled through
Stains, stains, stains, stains, blood in the rain
Shame, shame, shame, shame
He used my chest as a firin' range
Um, fire away (Fire away)
I'm feeling low, so I feel like I'm gon' get higher today (Higher away), ayy
Click-clack, fire away (Fire away)
Night crawlin', me and Michael Myers on a double date

[Chorus]
I'm apart, I'm exposed
I'm the flaws, hell if I know
I'm the cause, the cuts in a deep wound
Made it this far
If I can, then you can too
