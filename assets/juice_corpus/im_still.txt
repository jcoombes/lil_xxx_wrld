[Intro]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Like, oh, ooh, woah, oh, oh, oh-oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm holding my breath and watching my step
I'm listing regrets and you made that list
You're my depression
Your first impression was in deception, you were lyin'

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm still flexin' with my heart broken
Got my heart open, I'm not high yet
Bitch, I'm still moving, I'm in slow motion
I rolled my dosage, I'm getting higher
Bitch, I still, I still love my pills, Advils
You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel
Bitch, I still, I still love my pills, Advils
You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, ooh, woah, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, ooh, woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-ah

[Verse]
*exhaling*
Fell in love with your face off the shrooms
The way it animates your eyes in the room
I can see the stars when I'm gazing at you
Now I need the car with the stars in the roof, ooh
Elephant all in the room, she buried me in a tomb
I'm feeling over consumed
She walking me to my doom, I see her face in my room
When I'm alone in the room, I'ma blame that on the shrooms (Blame that on the shrooms)
[Bridge]
Oh, feeling ridiculed, feeling like a fool, don't know what to do
Lost my heart, don't got shit to lose

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm holding my breath and watching my step
I'm listing regrets and you made that list
You're my depression
Your first impression was in deception, you were lyin'

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm still flexin' with my heart broken
Got my heart open, I'm not high yet
Bitch, I'm still moving, I'm in slow motion
I rolled my dosage, I'm getting higher
Bitch, I still, I still love my pills, Advils
You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel
Bitch, I still, I still love my pills, Advils
You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel

[Outro]
Oh, ooh, woah, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, ooh, woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
