[Intro]
Cheers
Sippin' codeine like it's beer
I'm in London, so I'm screaming, "Cheers"

[Verse 1]
Man of the year, still got problems
Lookin' in the mirror, you look awful
Talkin' to myself, do it too often
JK, Juice WRLD, you're so awesome
I'm running up funds
Bottle full of pills, let's have fun
No cheap thrills, only rich ones
Fire drills, hotter than the sun

[Pre-Chorus]
My ups and downs
I'll jot them down
In London town
Cheers to the golden years

[Chorus]
Let's raise our hands, let's sing and dance
I know my lyrics saved you, I know my lyrics saved you
Let's raise our hands and sing and dance
I know my lyrics saved you, I know I helped you break through
[Verse 2]
Buzzin' like I'm Lightyear, infinity and beyond
Big-headed, in my mind, I'm always thinking of songs
Big dick too, probably won't fit in your mom
I made my shorty thick, that's the type of shit that I'm on
I got to admit it, she helped me find where I belong
Stayed down with me through all of my rights and my wrongs
So now it's me and her together a life long
Lock her heart up, hide the key, she ain't finna make bond

[Pre-Chorus]
My ups and downs
I'll jot them down
In London town
Cheers to the golden years
My ups and downs
I'll jot them down
In London town
Cheers to the golden years

[Chorus]
Let's raise our hands, let's sing and dance
I know my lyrics saved you, I know my lyrics saved you
Let's raise our hands and sing and dance
I know my lyrics saved you, I know I helped you break through
