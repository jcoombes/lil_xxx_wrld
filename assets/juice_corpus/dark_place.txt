[Intro]
Lost in a dark place, lost in a dark place
Lost in a dark place

[Verse]
Lost in a dark place, trapped in the crawl space
In my mind, I get lost, then I wake up in a coffin
They tell me they care, they're just in love with the music
So they'll never know about the pain I go through
It's like a chain of reactions, all these demon attacks
From all the drugs that I'm taking to the women distracting me
From being myself, it's like I'm losing my traction
Kiss death on the lips, I have a fatal attraction
This is my heart, watch as my problems inspire me
Tear me apart, won't let the demons take over me
They took it too far, now I need some surgery
I'm falling apart
It's like I'm lost in the motions, use this song as a rope
To wrap around the commotion, tie the knot at my throat
I look at death as a notion, I don't want it no more
But it's too late to reverse it as I fall on the floor

[Outro]
Lost in a dark place, lost in a dark place
Demons inspire me
Floor
