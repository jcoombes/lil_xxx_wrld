[Intro]
This the one take gang, this the next lil'...
This the one take gang song (Yeah, uh-huh)
Perc' give me a feelin'
Wockhardt just walked into the building
Huh, uh
Percs give me a feeling, I feel it (I feel it, ayy)
Percs give me a feeling, I feel it (Man, goddamn)
Like the Black Eyed Peas

[Chorus]
I got a feeling
Percs help me feel it, I feel it, uh
Problems, I numb and conceal them
Kinda like my feelings, but I still feel them
I just walked in the building
Look like a million, but I'm worth more than a million
I don't need no Ritalin, I'm focused on the millions
Disregard civilians
Until I get a house with a moat and a pavilion

[Verse 1]
I reek of good vibes
Smokin' on reefer, I'm high
Percocet fever
The type of pill to make you scratch until your nails gone (Yeah, yeah)
Drugs in my head, you heard what I said
No five, no ten, no fifteen, twenty, just Perc-30's in my meds
I told my mama I'm here to stay, no, she won't catch me dead
I'm too much of an idol, nigga, no Ryan Seacrest
Do it by my V-lone, 'lone
(This is about you, not me)
Alone, alone, alone (Slatt)
[Chorus]
I got a feeling
Percs help me feel it, I feel it, uh
Problems, I numb and conceal them
Kinda like my feelings, but I still feel them
I just walked in the building
Look like a million, but I'm worth more than a million
I don't need no Ritalin, I'm focused on the millions
Disregard civilians
Until I get a house with a moat and a pavilion

[Verse 2]
'Til I get a house with a moat and a pavilion
Walked into your building, nigga, I'm a villain
Feel like Dragon Ball, bitch, I'm Goku and you Krillin
Bickin' back, I'm boolin', these niggas be chillin'
All up in they feelings, me, I'm just winning
W-I-N-N-I-N-G (Spell it)
Boy, it's ain't no "I" in team but it's an "M-E" in team (Fuck)
I meant it's a "me" in team (Yeah)
I know I just fucked up, but bitch, I'm still the freestyle king, whoa
Her pussy wetter than olive oil, my watch cost a hundred more
My new girl a Lamborghin', your girl a Honda Accord
Mama told me I gotta stay focused, told her I am not a Ford
Focused, you notice when it disappear like hocus pocus
[Chorus]
I got a feeling
Percs help me feel it, I feel it, uh
Problems, I numb and conceal them
Kinda like my feelings, but I still feel them
I just walked in the building
Look like a million, but I'm worth more than a million
I don't need no Ritalin, I'm focused on the millions
Disregard civilians
Until I get a house with a moat and a pavilion (Let's go, let's go, let's go)
