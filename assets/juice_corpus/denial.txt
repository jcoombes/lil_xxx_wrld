[Intro]
Yeah, uhm
(Mumbles)
Oh-oh

[Chorus]
She want a title, I'm in denial
Don't need a rifle, everyone suicidal
I'ma burn a bridge, I feel like a pyro
I'ma say my prayers, I'll be hell bound tomorrow
I'm in my sorrow, oxy-my-codone
Does someone have a heart that I can borrow?
Tearing me apart
Does someone have a heart that I can borrow?
Borrow, oh

[Verse]
Time after time, they let me drown in my sorrow
I run through the night, I only wish for tomorrow
Love, love, love, got me walking in circles
Something isn't right
I'm living a lie
Ain't no you and I
Walking in circles
Something isn't right
[Chorus]
She want a title, I'm in denial
Don't need a rifle, everyone suicidal
I'ma burn a bridge, I feel like a pyro
I'ma say my prayers, I'll be hell bound tomorrow
I'm in my sorrow, oxy-my-codone
Does someone have a heart that I can borrow?
Tearing me apart
Does someone have a heart that I can borrow?
Borrow, borrow

[Outro]
It's crazy how I feel, right?
I wonder if this real life
Will I see tomorrow, tomorrow?
