[Intro]
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Up, up, and away, I been
Feel the walls in my brain and they're caving in
Outside those walls, there's an ocean, I can't swim
Especially with all these waves

[Chorus]
I'm walkin' in Prada, tryna solve my problems
Through the night, finding vibes, Moonlight Sonata
I try to deny, but you see the pills in my eyes
I tell her that I'm high, but she don't seem surprised
Walkin' in Prada, tryna solve my problems
Through the night, finding vibes, Moonlight Sonata
I try to deny, but you see the pills in my eyes
I tell her that I'm high, but she don't seem surprised (Uh)

[Verse]
Maybe I realize that my life is a ride
Buckle up, hold tight, take a left, turn right
GPS don't work and I can't see at night
So it's getting hard to drive, anxiety at a stoplight
Hard to think, easy to cry, that's how I know something's not right
Numb the pain with fun times, supermodels, Perc lines
Remember that one time everything was alright
Alright (Oh-oh-oh)
[Pre-Chorus]
Up, up, and away, I been
Feel the walls in my brain and they're caving in
Outside those walls, there's an ocean, I can't swim
Especially with all these waves

[Chorus]
I'm walkin' in Prada, tryna solve my problems
Through the night, finding vibes, Moonlight Sonata
I try to deny, but you see the pills in my eyes
I tell her that I'm high, but she don't seem surprised
Walkin' in Prada, tryna solve my problems
Through the night, finding vibes, Moonlight Sonata
I try to deny, but you see the pills in my eyes
I tell her that I'm high, but she don't seem surprised

[Outro]
Up, up, and away, I been
Feel the walls in my brain and they're caving in
Outside those walls, there's an ocean, I can't swim
Especially with all these waves
