[Intro]
Let's go, let's go
Chasing the lean
Let's go (Okay, okay)
Chasing the lean, rotting my brain
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
Let's do it

[Chorus]
Chasing the lean, rotting my brain, honestly (Ya dig?)
Drugs the only thing that's faithful to me, sorry to say (What, what? Ya dig?)
Groupie hoes wanna come my way (C'mon)
Come take this pic and get out my face (C'mon)
Ran into my main thing (Yeah, yeah)
Come take this dick and you can stay (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
It's my year, year, year, codeine sip, no beer (Uh-huh)
Holy shit, he's the shit, words from my peers (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Don't like me, you can suck a dick, that's how it goes around here (Yeah, suck a fucking dick)
Cowboy, oh yeah, big six shooter in the air
Drunky
You wanna fuck me, bitch, then fuck me (Let's do it)
You wanna kill me, nigga, then buck me (Let's do it)
These niggas really want me dead (C'mon)
I don't really think they that lucky (C'mon)
I told my bitch I love her (I did)
I hope she think I mean it (Whoa)
I wouldn't lie about that shit, trust me (At all)
I wouldn't lie about street shit, trust me (At all)
I wouldn't lie about drug shit, trust me (Oh no)
See that drug shit hide the ugly (Oh no)
And I ain't never been ugly, trust me (Oh no)
Dicked up in her brain, concussion (Uh-huh)
We had a Snoop Dogg discussion (We did)
A sexual eruption (Smash)
Open up them legs, I'm hungry (Let's go)
[Pre-Chorus]
Bank account eruptin' (Yeah)
I need me a safe or somethin' (Yeah)
I'm a dirt bike riding junkie (C'mon)
I don't need that Wraith for nothing (Let's go)
But it's a Wraith on my wrist or somethin' (Skrrt)
Hoes wanna rape my wrist or somethin' (All white)
Cops wanna raid my crib for nothing (Uh)
Just 'cause we black, that's how they comin' (Fuck 12, fuck 12, fuck 12)

[Chorus]
Chasin' the lean, rotting my brain, honestly (Chasin')
Drugs the only thing that's faithful to me, sorry to say (Faith)
Groupie hoes wanna come my way (C'mon)
Come take this pic and get out my face (C'mon)
That champagne glass on my kitchen counter (Yeah, yeah)
That's codeine in it, no Ace of Spades (Oh yeah)

[Verse 2]
Wait wait wait, wait wait wait, nigga, wait
Nigga, it's a wave, nigga, I'm a wave, you a slave
To these chains, forgettin' about the road our forefathers paved
But hey, who am I to talk? I'm AP gang, a hundred fifty on my wrist, no case
Used to bein' afraid, uh, coke on the dinner plate, uh
Brand new China set for the house, Versace dinner plates, uh
What your mama tell you about gettin' involved?
You got you a gun but you still too soft
You ain't gon' shoot that bitch at all
If I got it on me, I'ma let that bitch off
Hot boy, young Lil Wayne shit, you see the socks boy
Plus I'm a Glock boy, new clip
Huggin' a thot, boy, givin' 'em top where they brain is
I'm a rockstar lifestyle livin', dirt bike ridin', totin' stainless, I aim big
[Pre-Chorus]
Bank account eruptin'
I need me a safe or something (I do)
I'm a dirt bike riding junkie (Uh-huh)
I don't need that Wraith for nothing (Skrrt skrrt)
But it's a Wraith on my wrist or somethin' (Wrist)
Hoes wanna rape my wrist or somethin' (Rape my wrist)
Cops wanna raid my crib for nothing (Raid my crib)
Just 'cause we black, that's how they comin' (I know it, yeah)

[Chorus]
Chasing the lean, rotting my brain, honestly
Drugs the only thing that's faithful to me, sorry to say
Groupie hoes wanna come my way
Come take this pic and get out my face
That champagne glass on my kitchen counter
That's codeine in it, no Ace of Spades

[Beat Switch]

[Interlude]
Let me switch it up on y'all fuck niggas, haha
Dawn in denial, hey
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, whoa
Uh (Let's go)
[Chorus]
Double cup pleasure (Double)
Can I feel this way forever? (Forever)
It don't matter how fucked up I get off of the drugs
Still giving my effort, all my effort
Phone line going AWOL, I'm the plug now
They act like my music is the new drug in town
The bees knees (The bees knees), I am
The bees knees (The bees knees), bitch, I am
The bees knees
It's hard for these hoes to stay away
Now I got money, I can't afford loyalty
'Cause who the hell gotta pay for loyalty? Hey
To do what I do, you need a whole team
It's child's play to me, hey
The bees knees, I am
The bees knees, I am

[Refrain]
OC
Never do coke, no, fuck a nosebleed
Bentley white guts, cocaine, no seats
Dust in the Benz, smokin' thrax
Countin' up the racks, bitch, I'm the bees knees
I'm OC
Never do coke, no, fuck a nosebleed
Bentley white guts, cocaine, no seats
Dust in the Bentley, smokin' thrax
Countin' up these racks, I'm the bees knees
(I am the bees knees)

[Outro]
Hah, hah
Niggas not ready for this shit, homie
Listen to Juice talk, he talkin' that talk
'Cause you talkin' to a boss
That's real
My fault, I'm high
A death race for love
I ain't just racin' for love though (No I'm not)
My heart racin'
My money racin' (Facts), my mind racin' (Facts)
All black diamonds like I'm racist (Huh, you dig?)
"Lucid Dreams" still on your bitch playlist (Yes sir)
I took her and smiled and you lookin' like, "How could you say this?"
Timeless music bitch (Thank God for me, me, me)
Smokin' thrax, countin' racks (Bees knees)
No fuck racks, need a black card
That's how I'm gon' show you I'm hard
Yeah where the Percs at now?
(Talk that talk, Juice, stop fuckin' with these niggas)
I'm a businessman, so that mean I'm 'bout my business, man
(A businessman, I'm a businessman, nigga, a businessman, nigga)
Ayy, RP go that shit, this boy got that shit
(No cap, no cap, no cap, no cap)
I know y'all seen them old videos of Dream Team playin' basketball (Michael Jordan, Game 6, yeah yeah)
We just ran a three man weave
The bees knees
