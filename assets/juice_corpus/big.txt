[Intro]
Hmm, uh-huh
(Hit-Boy)
Bitch
Man, this life shit gettin' crazy, crazy
I done, I done made it
I done made it, made it, yeah
I'm sick and tired of these hatin' ass niggas, though
Let my dick breathe for a couple seconds, man, shit
Fuck nigga
Uh, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm on a Percocet, yeah, I just had to relapse
Even at my worst, I'm feeling like I am the best
I done Metta World Peace to myself like I'm Ron Artest
I never been a referee but I still got a Tec, Kel-Tec
Shoot you in your stomach, make this shit hard to digest
Rockstar, listening Jimi Hendrix in the projects, yeah
I'ma turn a nigga block to an art project
Picasso, I paint that, where the fuck is the bank at?
Army sergeant, no rank, yeah, okay

[Verse]
If you ain't payin' a hundred thousand, get them features out my face
50K to install a codeine fountain in my new estate
I got that pump, it's ironic how that pump made him pump his brakes
I ain't Lil Pump but I got double Glocks on me like Gucci Gang
We ball like Wilt Chamberlain, like the name of them old Gucci tapes
Yeah, I'm talkin' 'bout Gucci Mane
That lil' bitch like, "Burr," why she so insecure?
Who got the pills in here? How do you live in here?
I got my crib in here, havin' some kids, yeah
I do it big, yeah, big big, yeah
I do it big, yeah, big big, yeah (Let's go)
She saw me in the club, how did you get in here?
Fuck is you doin' here? Why is you shootin' here?
Doin' it big, yeah, big big, yeah
Doin' it big, yeah, big big, yeah
Yeah, away, away, away, away, away
You want bullshit, I hit you with that ol√©
Told my shooter I gotta prove myself no lame
Even when I stand up and hit it from the back I'ma still get laid
Your bitch a dragon, she run up on me, she get slayed
I took a piss in your dead homie grave, uh (Let's get it)
Chicago shit, Chicago nigga
Fuckin' with a Philadelphia bitch
Yeah, I'm super rich, I could pay your rent, Rollie doesn't tick
Chopper with the tints, pull up with the tints, clip is extended
Never gave a fuck, never gave a shit, only gettin' rich
Limb by limb, forgive and forget, man, I don't forget shit
You don't know when to stand
You got it bad, man, come in, oh
Oh, baby, come in
Man, I don't forget shit
Uh, yeah
[Chorus]
I'm on a Percocet, yeah, I just had to relapse
Even at my worst, I'm feeling like I am the best
I done Meta World Peace to myself like I'm Ron Artest
I never been a referee but I still got a Tec, Kel-Tec
Shoot you in your stomach, make this shit hard to digest
Rockstar, listening Jimi Hendrix in the projects, yeah
I'ma turn a nigga block to an art project
Picasso, I paint that, where the fuck is the bank at?
Army sergeant, no rank, yeah
