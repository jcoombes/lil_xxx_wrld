[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Tell me you love me
Tell me everything gon' be okay
Tell me you love me
Tell me you love me and you gon' stay
Tell me you love me
Tell me you love me, won't go nowhere
Tell me you love me
Tell me you love me

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
Bitch, I'm a druggie
So can you hide my drugs from me?
And when I get lonely
Can you be my company?
Drugs to the brain
Swervin' inside of a Benz truck
I cannot stay in my lane, um
Yes, I got you on my brain, duh (Duh)
Um, you can't hide, you can't run (You can't run)
Um, we're forever in love (In love)
Um, if you leave there'd be torment, torment, torment, torment
Don't run from me
You can't have it any other way
It's me or no one
If you leave, I'll take your life away
Like you were no one (You were no one)
So tell me you love me
Tell me you love me
Tell me it'll be okay
[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Tell me you love me
Tell me everything gon' be okay
Tell me you love me
Tell me you love me and you gon' stay
Tell me you love me
Tell me you love me, won't go nowhere
Tell me you love me
Tell me you love me

[Verse 2: Juice WRLD]
Heart on my sleeve, ball with it like a throwback
Mind in the clouds, I will never ever come back home
You fightin' through a text using all caps
Fuck this, screw that, you sayin' to send you back home
Well, baby girl, I don't want to do that
It's true that you the only home I know
Without you, all it ever does is snow
My voice too deep for a average ho
Babe, welcome to my world, dark and confusin'
Get lost in it often, the same way I'm lost in you
And it's often my mind that I'm losin'
See, half of it's stuck in a pill bottle, high and confused
Don't even know what the fuck I be doin'
Pray every day that I'm far from a nuisance
Tryna figure out how to live with the blueprints
To give you the heart out my chest 'cause I know that it's true (I know that it's true)
[Bridge: Juice WRLD]
I know that it's true (I know that it's true), I know it (I know it)
To give you the heart out my chest 'cause I know that it's true (I know that it's true)
So tell me you love me (Tell me you love me)
Tell me you love me (Tell me you love me)
Tell me you love me (Tell me you love me)

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Tell me you love me
Tell me everything gon' be okay
Tell me you love me
Tell me you love me and you gon' stay
Tell me you love me
Tell me you love me, won't go nowhere
Tell me you love me
Tell me you love me
Tell me you love me
Tell me everything gon' be okay
Tell me you love me
Tell me you love me and you gon' stay
Tell me you love me
Tell me you love me, won't go nowhere
Tell me you love me
Tell me you love me
